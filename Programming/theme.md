# Theme: Empowering Financial Literacy

## Theme Overview
In today’s world, financial literacy is an essential skill, yet many people—especially young adults and teens—lack a strong understanding of basic financial concepts, such as budgeting, saving, investing, and managing debt. This theme, "Empowering Financial Literacy," challenges participants to create digital solutions that help users build better financial habits and improve their knowledge. By developing accessible, engaging, and user-friendly tools, participants will have the opportunity to address real-life challenges people face in managing personal finances.

## Suggested Technology Stack

To ensure accessibility and engagement, participants are encouraged to use the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React, Vue, or Angular for more advanced teams)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Python (Flask or Django), or Firebase for database management
- **Mobile Development**: Flutter, React Native, or native iOS/Android development
- **Data and Analytics**: Simple financial calculators or public financial literacy APIs (such as news or stock price APIs) to integrate real-world data

## Equipment Available

The following equipment will be available on-site:
- **Workstations**: Computer systems for development
- **Projector**: Available for team presentations
