# Theme: Circular Economy – Sustainable Waste Management

## Theme Overview
Sustainable waste management requires a shift from traditional linear systems to a circular economy approach, which emphasizes minimizing environmental impact, conserving resources, and enhancing efficiency. In a circular economy, materials are kept in use for as long as possible through strategies like recycling, reuse, and regeneration, thus moving away from the "take-make-dispose" model. 

This theme, **Circular Economy: Sustainable Waste Management**, invites participants to develop innovative solutions to improve resource efficiency, reduce environmental harm, and generate economic value. Specific focus areas may include:
- **E-Waste**: Addressing the challenge of electronic waste by finding ways to recycle and reuse valuable components.
- **Plastics**: Developing new methods to recycle or reduce plastic waste.
- **Organic Waste**: Creating sustainable methods for organic waste management to reduce landfill dependency.

## Case Problems

Participants are challenged to think critically about how to:
- Improve current waste management technologies and practices.
- Align waste management systems with circular economy principles.
- Propose actionable, sustainable strategies for the future.

## Expected Deliverables

Each team is required to submit the following deliverables electronically before the end of the design period:

1. **Report**: A written report with the following specifications:
   - **Length**: No more than one (1) page per case, not including appendices.
   - **Format**:
     - Teams may choose to shorten one of the reports and use the remaining space for the other, provided both reports are in a single document that does not exceed two single-sided pages in total.
     - Alternatively, teams may combine both solutions into one consolidated report of up to two single-sided pages if this format better conveys their ideas.
     - Use 12 point Times New Roman font with single spacing.
   - **Content**: The report should detail each proposed solution and will be made available to the judges before the team’s presentation.

2. **Presentation**: A presentation summarizing and supporting the team’s proposed solution(s).

## Submission Guidelines

- All deliverables must be submitted electronically by the deadline outlined in the design period i.e, **before the end of Solution Development Phase 2**. A link will be provided to participants to submit their documents.
- Only the submitted report and presentation will be provided to the judges for evaluation.
- **Important**: Submissions that do not meet competition rules and requirements may result in disqualification.
