# Financial Decision Simulator: Visualizing the Impact of Personal Financial Choices

## Background

Personal financial planning involves making a series of decisions that can significantly impact one's financial well-being over time. Understanding the long-term effects of these decisions—such as investing in stocks, purchasing a home, adjusting spending habits, or changing savings strategies—is crucial for financial wellness. However, the complexity of financial variables and their interactions often makes it challenging to foresee outcomes without appropriate tools.


## The Challenge

Design and develop an interactive simulation application that empowers users to model and visualize the impact of various financial decisions over a 10-year period. Using the provided datasets to simulate data prediction, the application should allow users to input a sequence of financial choices and observe how these decisions influence their financial status over time. The goal is to help users explore different strategies, understand trade-offs, and make informed decisions based on simulated outcomes.

## Features Overview


### Timeline-Based Decision Simulation 

Users can make decisions for each year, such as: 
- Investing in stocks or mutual funds.
- Reducing non-essential expenses.
- Selling a house and switching to renting.
- Depositing money into a saving account.

### Financial Visualization:
Display key metrics over time:
- Net worth, savings, investments, and total spending.
- Impact of inflation on purchasing power and income.
- Yearly and cumulative returns from investments.

### Outcome Analysis:
Provide users with a summary at the end of the simulation or decision point:
- Highlight key outcomes (e.g., total savings, gains from investments).
- Show alternative scenarios if different decisions were made (e.g., “If you didn’t sell the house in Year 5...”).
- Offer insights into financial resilience based on their simulated decisions.

**Alternatively, you could provide a simple summary.**



## Datasets Provided:

The dataset contains basic financial data over a 10-year period (You may ignore the year 2022 data):

- **Stock and Mutual Fund**: contains the daily mutual fund price and stock opening & closing price
- **Income and Expenses**: contains annual income, inflation rate, monthly expenses and rent price of the year.
- **House and Mortgage**: includes the house prices and mortgage monthly payment 
- **Saving Account Interest Rate**: contains saving account annual interest rate.

For simplicity, details such as other expense or potential incomes are omitted. You are allowed to make any necessary assumption.

## Deliverables:

1. Prototype:

    A functional app capable of running at least one complete simulation with multiple decision points.

    Include a GUI for user interaction and result visualization.

2. Scenario Data and Visualized outcome:

    Save user decisions and outcomes as a downloadable file (e.g., CSV or JSON).
    
    Save the visualized outcome as PNG or PDF.
