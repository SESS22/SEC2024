# Case 1: Re-engineer the Existing E-Waste Management System for a Circular Economy

## Background
Electronic waste (e-waste) has become one of the fastest-growing waste streams globally. E-waste generation per capita rose from **8.3 kg in 2000** to **25.3 kg in 2020** and is expected to reach **31.5 kg by 2030**. This increase is driven by several factors:
- Rapid technological advancements
- Shorter product lifespans
- High consumer demand for the latest electronics

The rise of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** has intensified this trend, as AI applications require high computational power, prompting frequent hardware upgrades and replacements. As a result, the turnover rate of electronic devices has increased, adding to the volume of e-waste.

E-waste contains both valuable materials (e.g., **gold, silver, copper, rare earth elements**) and hazardous substances that can harm the environment and human health if not managed properly. However, current e-waste management systems struggle to handle the increasing volume and complexity of e-waste, resulting in low recycling rates and considerable environmental challenges.

Transitioning to a **circular economy** is essential for sustainable e-waste management. This approach focuses on keeping products, components, and materials at their highest utility and value for as long as possible. Achieving this requires a complete rethinking of the **electronic product lifecycle**, from design and manufacturing to consumption and end-of-life management.

## Problem Statement
Your task is to **re-engineer the existing e-waste management system** to facilitate a transition towards a circular economy. The goal is to develop an innovative solution that addresses the escalating challenges of e-waste generation, especially given the rapid technological advancements and the increasing demand for AI hardware.

### Objectives
- **Increase Recycling Rates**: Develop methods to enhance the efficiency and capacity of e-waste recycling to recover valuable materials effectively.
- **Minimize Environmental Impact**: Propose processes or technologies to reduce hazardous emissions and waste in e-waste processing.
- **Promote Product Longevity**: Suggest design and manufacturing practices that increase the lifespan of electronic devices and reduce the frequency of replacement.
- **Encourage Responsible Consumption**: Create strategies that incentivize consumers to make environmentally responsible choices when buying, using, and disposing of electronics.

### Expected Deliverables
Each team should submit the following:

1. **Report**: A one-page report detailing the proposed solution, or a combined two-page document if addressing multiple cases.
2. **Presentation**: A presentation summarizing the solution, which will be reviewed by judges.

Please refer to theme.md for detailed instructions.

### Evaluation Criteria
Teams will be evaluated based on:
- **Innovation and Feasibility**: How creative and practical the solution is in addressing the challenges of e-waste management.
- **Impact**: The potential environmental and economic benefits of the proposed solution.
- **Alignment with Circular Economy Principles**: How well the solution supports a circular lifecycle for electronic products.
- **Presentation**: Clarity, organization, and effectiveness in conveying the solution.
Refer to the Rulebook for detailed judging matrix.
