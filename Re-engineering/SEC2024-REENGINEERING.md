# Theme: Circular Economy – Sustainable Waste Management

## Theme Overview
Sustainable waste management requires a shift from traditional linear systems to a circular economy approach, which emphasizes minimizing environmental impact, conserving resources, and enhancing efficiency. In a circular economy, materials are kept in use for as long as possible through strategies like recycling, reuse, and regeneration, thus moving away from the "take-make-dispose" model. 

This theme, **Circular Economy: Sustainable Waste Management**, invites participants to develop innovative solutions to improve resource efficiency, reduce environmental harm, and generate economic value. Specific focus areas may include:
- **E-Waste**: Addressing the challenge of electronic waste by finding ways to recycle and reuse valuable components.
- **Plastics**: Developing new methods to recycle or reduce plastic waste.
- **Organic Waste**: Creating sustainable methods for organic waste management to reduce landfill dependency.

## Case Problems

Participants are challenged to think critically about how to:
- Improve current waste management technologies and practices.
- Align waste management systems with circular economy principles.
- Propose actionable, sustainable strategies for the future.

## Expected Deliverables

Each team is required to submit the following deliverables electronically before the end of the design period:

1. **Report**: A written report with the following specifications:
   - **Length**: No more than one (1) page per case, not including appendices.
   - **Format**:
     - Teams may choose to shorten one of the reports and use the remaining space for the other, provided both reports are in a single document that does not exceed two single-sided pages in total.
     - Alternatively, teams may combine both solutions into one consolidated report of up to two single-sided pages if this format better conveys their ideas.
     - Use 12 point Times New Roman font with single spacing.
   - **Content**: The report should detail each proposed solution and will be made available to the judges before the team’s presentation.

2. **Presentation**: A presentation summarizing and supporting the team’s proposed solution(s).

## Submission Guidelines

- All deliverables must be submitted electronically by the deadline outlined in the design period i.e, **before the end of Solution Development Phase 2**. A link will be provided to participants to submit their documents.
- Only the submitted report and presentation will be provided to the judges for evaluation.
- **Important**: Submissions that do not meet competition rules and requirements may result in disqualification.

Participants are encouraged to explore creative, feasible solutions that can contribute to a more sustainable and efficient waste management system. Good luck!


# Case 1: Re-engineer the Existing E-Waste Management System for a Circular Economy

## Background:

Electronic waste (e-waste) has become one of the fastest-growing waste streams globally. The e-waste generation per capita increased dramatically from 8.3 kg in 2000 to 25.3 kg in 2020 and is projected to reach 31.5 kg by 2030. This surge is driven by rapid technological advancements, decreasing product lifespans, and consumer demand for the latest electronics.
The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies has further accelerated this trend. AI applications require substantial computational power, leading to frequent hardware upgrades and replacements to keep up with the performance demands. This results in a higher turnover rate of electronic devices, contributing significantly to the increasing volume of e-waste.
E-waste contains valuable materials like gold, silver, copper, and rare earth elements, as well as hazardous substances that can harm the environment and human health if not properly managed. Current e-waste management systems are struggling to cope with the volume and complexity of e-waste, leading to low recycling rates and significant environmental challenges.
Transitioning to a circular economy—where products, components, and materials are kept at their highest utility and value at all times—is essential for sustainable e-waste management. This involves rethinking the entire lifecycle of electronic products, from design and manufacturing to consumption and end-of-life management.

## Problem Statement:
Your task is to re-engineer the existing e-waste management system to facilitate the transition towards a circular economy. The goal is to develop an innovative solution that addresses the escalating challenges of e-waste generation, particularly in the context of rapid technological advancements and the growing demand for AI hardware.


# Case 2: Re-engineer Seneca’s Waste Disposal System

## Background:

Seneca Polytechnic has an existing waste disposal system that uses computer vision (CV) technology to identify and sort waste into the appropriate recycling, compost, and landfill streams. Despite the advanced system, waste is still frequently disposed of incorrectly, leading to contamination in recycling bins, low recycling rates, and missed opportunities to divert organic waste from landfills. The issues may stem from improper use by students and staff, system inefficiencies, or gaps in public awareness about waste management.

## Problem Statement:

Your task is to re-engineer the existing waste disposal system at Seneca College to improve its accuracy, user compliance, and overall effectiveness in promoting sustainability. The goal is to enhance the existing CV technology and implement additional solutions to ensure waste is disposed of correctly while aligning with the principles of a circular economy.
